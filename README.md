# Personal-Portfolio-2
This is a soft Personal Portfolio to flex some of the programming muscles. My intention with my project is to attract people that love a great story line, character development, and animation by randomizing Anime quotes. Hopefully it will showcase some of the abilities that I've learned as well as attracting newcomers to Anime and to spark their curiosity on why Anime is not just "cartoons"!
